TO DO

  write note header bar...
  re-do favicon to have gradient background and dark foreground

  look up new ES version async await syntax
    -use it for patching when you click into and out of fullscreen
    -wait for it to update before switching
    -or maybe is it because it re-renders the component first and then
    loads the note



login modal animation
extra special final touch: night mode. dark blues with white text.
