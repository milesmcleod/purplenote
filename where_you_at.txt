Wednesday, 11/22/17

-i am done with auth and the splash and the transitions

-deployed to heroku

-completed notes backend

-complete notes. however, something to think about and come back to:

  think about the transitions. why is a new note rendering for a split second before showing the saved note when it saves a new note? i think there could be a promise.then(()=>{}) there that would save that split second render. maybe bring that up with Andres. and
  look up new ES version async await syntax:
    -use it for patching when you click into and out of fullscreen
    -wait for it to update before switching
    -or maybe is it because it re-renders the component first and then
    loads the note

notebooks gameplan:

  (ASIDE) deleting notebooks should put all the notes in the trash.


  -write the components:

  -write the trash functionality and change around the note trash callbacks to change trashBoolean
  -erase and restore buttons
  -once the notebooks CRUD is working, write a notebook header for the notes nav and filter out trash notes for regular notes index, and filter out trash + non-notebook notes for the notebook notes index
  -make an emptyTrash function that deletes each note from the DB
  -write a popup function that alerts you that you have moved an item to the trash
  -write a dropdown that gives the user the ability to edit which notebook a note belongs to (right above the note title in the note show)
  -write javascript animation for the show bar, with a modal that greys out the screen
  -write the search functionality in a modal

  -note info (this should be easy)
  -notebook info (for editing notebook titles)


don't forget to add whitespace to the bottom borders of the notes

refactor json to use partials
login modal animation
extra special final touch: night mode. dark blues with white text.
