  -write a dropdown that gives the user the ability to edit which notebook a note belongs to (right above the note title in the note show)
    -when an account is created, a notebook should also be created and then set as the default notebook. unless specified otherwise, or unless a notebook is selected at the time that a new note is created, the default notebook for items to be added to should be {username}'s notebook.
