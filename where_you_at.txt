Wednesday, 11/22/17

-i am done with auth and the splash and the transitions

-deployed to heroku

-completed notes backend

-workable frontend note structure

-gameplan:
  -need to figure out how to wrap note content in the index item
  -icons to build:

    barnav:
      new note
      search

      shortcut
      note
      notebook
      tag

    note header
      shortcut (reuse)
      trash
      fullscreen

    note index items
      shortcut (reuse)
      trash (reuse)



thinking out loud:

utilize the UI slice of state like the splash page does in order to
toggle between fullscreen and regular view. think about how to
integrate the form's submit button and the rest of the header bar.
  -enterFullscreen and exitFullscreen actions (check)
  -

need transitions into and out of fullscreen.


figure out how to do text overflow for index titles and contents
