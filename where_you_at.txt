-i am done with auth and the splash and the transitions

-deployed to heroku

-completed notes backend

-notes gameplan:
  -notes nav: need selected note to have a thicker border
  -need to figure out how to wrap note content in the index item
  -need default selected note to be the first child
  -need to add something that converts dates into a time ago and
  then send that up when notes are fetched (look up ruby/js datetime
  object formats)
  -icons to build:

    barnav:
      new note
      search

      shortcut
      note
      notebook
      tag

    note header
      shortcut (reuse)
      trash
      fullscreen

    note index items
      shortcut (reuse)
      trash (reuse)



thinking out loud:

utilize the UI slice of state like the splash page does in order to
toggle between fullscreen and regular view. think about how to
integrate the form's submit button and the rest of the header bar.

need transitions into and out of fullscreen.

saving a note should save, and then when the notes nav receives new
props, it should also receive UI -> selected note and then simulate a
click on that note, so that the URL changes. then the note is free to
autoupdate.

need a default note to be selected. it all starts with the relationship
between the UI state and the URL...
first child of parent should be selected. use DOM selectors to grab that?


add padding to note index items
